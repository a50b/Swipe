# Swipe

Swipe is a homepage web design inspired by the leading digital payments company, Stripe. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created this site to challenge my design and development skills, focusing on emulating and adapting the clean, effective layout characteristic of top-tier tech companies. This project served as a practical exercise to refine my capabilities in producing industry-standard, aesthetic designs.
